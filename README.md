### **Task 1: Fixing and Integration**

Start by analyzing the project and getting familiar with its structure.  
Currently, the chatbot always returns static responses.  

Your goal is to:
- Update the chatbot so it communicates with the backend.  
- Integrate the **Infomaniak Chat Completion API**.  

Once you are able to send and receive messages from the **Gemma 3** model successfully, the task is complete.  
Be ready to present your changes and explain your approach.

### **Task 2: Hard Mode â€“ Embeddings (Optional Extension)**

After completing and discussing Task 1, you can choose **one** of the following enhancements:

#### Option A â€“ Add a Document as a Knowledge Base
Integrate a document so the chatbot can use its content to provide context-aware answers.

#### Option B â€“ Improved Low-Token-Cost Memory
Design a lightweight memory approach that helps the chatbot maintain short-term context without significantly increasing token usage.

**Note:**  
Each task is designed to assess problem-solving, technical reasoning, and familiarity with integrating AI capabilities in a full-stack environment.
